# Amazon-Sales-data-analysis
Task 1: Data Loading & Cleaning
Loaded a CSV file into a DataFrame using pandas.
Performed a sneak peek of the dataset (using .head(), .shape, .columns, and .info()).
Converted column data types from object to float for accurate analysis.
Filled in missing product ratings manually based on information from Amazon (used default 3.9 where applicable).
Used .describe() to generate descriptive statistics for numeric columns.
Handled missing values by identifying and cleaning rows with nulls.
verified duplication: Checked for duplicate records – no duplicates were found.
